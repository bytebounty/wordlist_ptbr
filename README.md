# Brazilian Portuguese Wordlist

## Objectives

The idea is to build a selection of Brazilian Portuguese words that are
**good enough** to be used on computer-generated mnemonic pasphrases, such as
the ones described in the [BIP-0039 draft][bip39] and adopted by some
cryptocurrencies clients and wallets.

### Attributes of a "good enough" wordlist

Following the footsteps of other languages wordlists currently listed
in [this BIP39 document][wordlists], specially the French and Spanish ones,
the selection of words for this list must consider the following
features/attributes:

- High priority on simple and common portuguese words.
- Only words > 6 letters.
